This repository includes additional implementations of the Are-we-fast-yet benchmark suite.

See here for the main repository of the Are-we-fast-yet suite: https://github.com/smarr/are-we-fast-yet.
See also the ORIGINAL_README.md file in this repository.

Each additional implementation is in a separate subdirectory (e.g. "Cpp", "Oberon", "FreePascal"); see there for more information.
