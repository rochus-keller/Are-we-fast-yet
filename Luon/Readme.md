This is a version of the "Are We Fast Yet?" benchmark suite
migrated to the Luon language.

The implementation was directly derived from the Oberon+ implementation from https://github.com/rochus-keller/Are-we-fast-yet/tree/main/Oberon.


NOTE: this is still work in progress; all benchmarks besides Json work with Luon IDE >= 0.6 and show the same performance as the Lua implementation;
      though Json produces memory corruption, debugging WIP
