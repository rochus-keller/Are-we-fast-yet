This is a version of the "Are We Fast Yet?" benchmark suite
migrated to the Luon language.

The implementation was directly derived from the Oberon+ implementation from https://github.com/rochus-keller/Are-we-fast-yet/tree/main/Oberon.

The results show about the same performance as the Lua implementation. See Results.ods and Results.pdf for more information.
