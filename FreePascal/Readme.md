This is a version of the "Are We Fast Yet?" benchmark suite
migrated to FreePascal 3.2.2.

The implementation was directly derived from the C++ and Oberon implementations.

Since Run.pas depends on the unix module for fpgettimeofday(), the implementation doesn't work on Windows (yet); I didn't test it on macOS.

It can easily be built using the command "fpc Main.pas".

So far all microbenchmarks have been implemented and measurements have been conducted.
The results are [reported here](./Are-we-fast-yet_FreePascal_results.pdf). 
When compiled with -O4, the code generated by the FreePascal 3.2.2 compiler achieves about 60% of the C++ version, and about 140% of the JavaScript V8 or Mono CLR version. It's interesting to note that the -03 option produces slower code than the -O2 option.

This is work in progress; not all benchmarks are implemented yet.
