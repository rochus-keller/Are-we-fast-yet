This is a version of the "Are We Fast Yet?" benchmark suite migrated to the Oberon 90 language.

The implementation was directly derived from the C implementation from https://github.com/rochus-keller/Are-we-fast-yet/tree/main/C
by Rochus Keller supported by Perplexity with the Gemini 2.5 and Claude 4.0 Sonnet models.


NOTE: this is work in progress, not all benchmarks are migrated yet
